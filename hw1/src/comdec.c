 * Main compression function.
 * Reads a sequence of bytes from a specified input stream, segments the
 * input data into blocks of a specified maximum number of bytes,
 * uses the Sequitur algorithm to compress each block of input to a list
 * of rules, and outputs the resulting compressed data transmission to a
 * specified output stream in the format detailed in the header files and
 * assignment handout.  The output stream is flushed once the transmission
 * is complete.
 *
 * The maximum number of bytes of uncompressed data represented by each
 * block of the compressed transmission is limited to the specified value
 * "bsize".  Each compressed block except for the last one represents exactly
 * "bsize" bytes of uncompressed data and the last compressed block represents
 * at most "bsize" bytes.
 *
 * @param in  The stream from which input is to be read.
 * @param out  The stream to which the block is to be written.
 * @param bsize  The maximum number of bytes read per block.
