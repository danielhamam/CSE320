 * "small" values (i.e. < FIRST_NONTERMINAL), and nonterminal symbols have "large" values
 * (i.e. >= FIRST_NONTERMINAL).
 * @param rule  For a terminal symbol, this parameter should be NULL.  For a nonterminal
 * symbol, this parameter can be used to specify a rule having that nonterminal at its head.
 * In that case, the reference count of the rule is increased by one and a pointer to the rule
 * is stored in the symbol.  This parameter can also be NULL for a nonterminal symbol if the
 * associated rule is not currently known and will be assigned later.
 * @return  A pointer to the new symbol, whose value and rule fields have been initialized
 * according to the parameters passed, and with other fields zeroed.  If the symbol storage
 * is exhausted and a new symbol cannot be created, then a message is printed to stderr and
 * abort() is called.

 * When this function is called, if there are any recycled symbols, then one of those is removed
 * from the recycling list and used to satisfy the request.
 * Otherwise, if there currently are no recycled symbols, then a new symbol is allocated from
 * the main symbol_storage array and the num_symbols variable is incremented to record the
